# Defines expand_workspace_vars, sourced by the action steps that pass
# arguments to Maven. It lives in a file rather than in each step
# because the build, the JaCoCo mode resolver and the aggregate report
# pass all have to read the arguments Maven actually receives; a copy
# per step would let them drift apart and disagree about a path.
# Maven interpolates ${...} only in a value reaching it through POM
# interpolation. A user property a plugin reads directly,
# -Djacoco.dataFile or -Dsonar.* among them, keeps the literal text,
# and the shell does not help either: it word-splits an argument
# string but never re-expands ${...} inside the value. Jenkins
# expanded these before Maven started, so a caller writing an
# absolute workspace path reasonably expects the same.
# Expand a fixed list of workspace variables. Bash string operations
# rather than eval or a subprocess: nothing here executes, so $(...),
# backticks and $((...)) stay inert, and the caller gains no
# dependency beyond the shell it already runs in. The name list is
# explicit because the calling step's environment holds GITHUB_TOKEN
# and whatever env-secrets the caller injected; anything outside the
# list, including Maven's own ${project.*} and ${settings.*}, passes
# through for Maven to resolve.
